## Science communication

I am passionate about the importance of engaging with the public and communities in which we work on the research we do.

### Selected Activities

- **School workshops** — I delivered two workshops on gravitational waves for high-school students in Milan.  
- **Volunteering** — I represented the James Webb Space Telescope at BlueDot festival in Manchester, UK. I volunteered at the Cosmonauts exhibition at the Science Museum in London.
- **Music projects** — Contributed accompanying text for Arthur Jeffes' 'Sounds of the Universe' piano composition which is based on gravitational wave chirp data! Listen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZVbxfPGi08" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here!</a>
- **Science writing and editing** — I am an Astrophysics Editor at the arts-science magazine SEISMA and was previously a science writer at the London Institute for Mathematical Sciences. I was also an author for Astrobites during my PhD, where I summarised technical publications for undergraduates.
