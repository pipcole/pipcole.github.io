My research focuses on using **gravitational waves** as a probe of the **dark sector** of the universe. I work on both theoretical and data analysis aspects of extracting fundamental physics information from next-generation gravitational wave data including **LISA**, **Einstein Telescope**, and **Cosmic Explorer**.

### Collaborations
I am a core member of the **LISA Consortium**, and I co-chair the **Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO)** gravitational waves working group with Nicola Bellomo.
